# FULL v0 System Prompts, AI models and tools used by v0

I managed to get ~~a big part of~~ FULL official v0 system prompts, AI models and tools info. Over 2.8k lines

# There have been some allegations of the VP of AI of v0, Jared Palmer, saying that the system prompt is a hallucination. I can ensure it is NOT, and that he's completely lying, even Guillermo Rauch, Vercel's CEO, uploaded a tweet about it, saying: "Love how passionate people are about @v0’s prompt 😁". Check this out, he's lying: https://x.com/viarnes/status/1898078086798901329?s=46

LATEST UPDATE: 08/03/2025

You can check it out in v0.txt, v0 model.txt and v0 tools.txt

~~And now the question is, what model is v0 using? soon. 👀~~ v0 AI MODELS INFO RELEASED! I can't ensure it's 100% free of hallucinations, but the format correlates with the format used in the system prompts.

The default model of v0 is GPT-4o, and for reasoning, it uses DeepSeek. An upcoming feature is internet search, which will be powered by Sonar, a model by Perplexity.


# Private forked repo from vo, will update if its really working
